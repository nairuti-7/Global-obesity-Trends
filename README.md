# Global Trends and Disparities in Obesity Prevalence: A Temporal Analysis Across Region, Age and Sex from 1990-2024

## Abstract 
Background: Obesity is a growing global health challenge, with rising prevalence, increasing the 
risk of chronic diseases, making it critical to understand trends by age, sex, time, and region to 
inform targeted interventions. This study aimed to assess the association of demographic and 
geographic factors with obesity prevalence from 1990 to 2024, compare percentage changes 
between adolescents and adults, and visualize global patterns and disparities. 
Methods: Data from two Global Burden of Disease (GBD 2021) datasets covering adolescents 
and adults across 204 countries from 7 regions were merged. The study included mean obesity 
prevalence from 1990 to 2024. A multivariable linear regression with robust standard errors was 
conducted to evaluate associations of sex, regions, age groups and decades with mean obesity 
prevalence. Percentage change in obesity prevalence between 1990 and 2024 was calculated and 
compared between adolescents and adults using t-test. Interactive visualizations were generated 
to illustrate the trends. 
Results: Significant associations were found between obesity prevalence and age group, sex, 
decade, and region (p < 0.001). While statistically meaningful differences were found amongst 
all variables, higher prevalence was observed in females, older age groups, and in certain regions 
such as North America and Oceania. The percentage change in obesity prevalence (1990-2024) 
between adolescents and adults did not differ significantly (p = 0.8659) but was higher in adults. 
Conclusion: This study highlights substantial geographic and demographic disparities in obesity 
prevalence. The findings underscore the need for region-specific and population-targeted public 
health interventions to address the escalating global health burden.
